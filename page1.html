                I'm not the type of person to get bored easily. And I think that has everything
                to do with curiosity. I'm an explorer at heart and love to discover new delights.
                <br>
                <br>
                I spend most of my free time reading or listening to music. Creating playlists
                for every occasion has become an addiction! I also enjoy writing (purely for my own entertainment),
                and researching random topics that spark my interests. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Spending time outdoors is important to me as well, especially when traveling. I'm perfectly 
                content strolling through nature and appreciating its beauty. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For several years now, my friends and I have been meeting up regularly to play Dungeons and Dragons.
                <br>
                <br>
                We also have a tradition we call "Thanksinging." Either the night of or after Thanksgiving, we reserve a Karaoke
                room and make proper fools of ourselves. 
                <br>
                <br>
                With my husband, friends and/or family, I also love going to see live music (the symphony included!),
                taking trips to museums, and the theater. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Since I was a kid, my family have been taking trips together, enjoying various activities. Camping and 
                floating the river in New Braunfels, skiing or snowboarding in Colorado or New Mexico, and lots of beach
                time in Cabo!
